		<h1>JavaScript Reserved Words</h1>
		<p>In JavaScript, some identifiers are reserved words and cannot be used as variables or function names.</p>
		<h1>JavaScript Standards</h1>
		<p>ECMAScript 3 (ES3) was released in December 1999.</p>
		<p>ECMAScript 4 (ES4) was abandoned.</p>
		<p>ECMAScript 5 (ES5) was released in December 2009.</p>
		<p>ECMAScript 6 (ES6) was released in June 2015, and is the latest official version of JavaScript.</p>
		<p>Time passes, and we are now beginning to see complete support for ES5/ES6 in all modern browsers.</p>
