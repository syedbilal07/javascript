		<h1>JavaScript Debugging</h1>
		<p>It is easy to get lost writing JavaScript code without a debugger.</p>
		<p>It is difficult to write JavaScript code without a debugger.</p>
		<p>Your code might contain syntax errors, or logical errors, that are difficult to diagnose.</p>
		<p>Often, when JavaScript code contains errors, nothing will happen. There are no error messages, and you will get no
		indications where to search for errors.</p>
		<h2>NOTE : - Normally, errors will happen, every time you try to write some new JavaScript code.</h2>
		<h1>JavaScript Debuggers</h1>
		<p>Searching for errors in programming code is called code debugging.</p>
		<p>Debugging is not easy. But fortunately, all modern browsers have a built-in debugger.</p>
		<p>Built-in debuggers can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported to the user.</p>
		<p>With a debugger, you can also set breakpoints (places where code execution can be stopped), and examine variables while the
		code is executing.</p>
		<p>Normally, otherwise follow the steps at the bottom of this page, you activate debugging in your browser with the F12 key,
		and select "Console" in the debugger menu.</p>
		<h1>The console.log() Method</h1>
		<p>If your browser supports debugging, you can use console.log() to display JavaScript values in the debugger window:</p>
		<button onclick="consoleLogMethod()" class="btn btn-success btn-lg">Console Log Method</button>
		<p id="consoleLogMethod"></p>
		<h1>Setting Breakpoints</h1>
		<p>In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code.</p>
		<p>At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values.</p>
		<p>After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button).</p>
		<h1>The debugger Keyword</h1>
		<p>The debugger keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function.</p>
		<p>This has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the debugger.</p>
		<p>If no debugging is available, the debugger statement has no effect.</p>
		<p>With the debugger turned on, this code will stop executing before it executes the third line.</p>
		<button onclick="debuggerMethod()" class="btn btn-success btn-lg">Debugger Method</button>
		<p id="debuggerMethod"></p>
		<h1>Major Browsers' Debugging Tools</h1>
		<p>Normally, you activate debugging in your browser with F12, and select "Console" in the debugger menu.</p>
		<h1>Did You Know?</h1>
		<p><img src="lamp.jpg" alt="lamp" height="auto" width="auto" />Debugging is the process of testing, finding, and reducing bugs (errors) in computer programs.<br />
		   The first known computer bug was a real bug (an insect), stuck in the electronics.</p>
