		<h1>JavaScript Performance</h1>
		<p>How to speed up your JavaScript code.</p>
		<h1>Reduce Activity in Loops</h1>
		<p>Loops are often used in programming.</p>
		<p>Each statement in a loop, including the for statement, is executed for each iteration of the loop.</p>
		<p>Search for statements or assignments that can be placed outside the loop.</p>
		<p>Bad Code</p>
		<pre>for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {</pre>
		<p>Better Code</p>
		<pre>l = arr.length;
for (i = 0; i < l; i++) {
		</pre>
		<p>The bad code accesses the length property of an array each time the loop is iterated.</p>
		<p>The better code accesses the length property outside the loop, and makes the loop run faster.</p>
		<h1>Reduce DOM Access</h1>
		<p>Accessing the HTML DOM is very slow, compared to other JavaScript statements.</p>
		<p>If you expect to access a DOM element several times, access it once, and use it as a local variable:</p>
		<button onclick="reduceDomAccess()" class="btn btn-success btn-lg">Reduce DOM Access</button>
		<p id="reduceDomAccess"></p>
		<h1>Reduce DOM Size</h1>
		<p>Keep the number of elements in the HTML DOM small.</p>
		<p>This will always improve page loading, and speed up rendering (page display), especially on smaller devices.</p>
		<p>Every attempt to search the DOM (like getElementsByTagName) will benefit from a smaller DOM.</p>
		<h1>Avoid Unnecessary Variables</h1>
		<p>Don't create new variables if you don't plan to save values.</p>
		<p>Often you can replace code like this:</p>
		<pre>var fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fullName; 
		</pre>
		<p>With this:</p>
		<pre>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = firstName + " " + lastName
		</pre>
		<h1>Delay JavaScript Loading</h1>
		<p>Putting your scripts at the bottom of the page body, lets the browser load the page first.</p>
		<p>While a script is downloading, the browser will not start any other downloads. In addition all parsing and rendering
		   activity might be blocked.
		</p>
		<h2><img src="lamp.jpg" alt="lamp" height="auto" width="auto" />NOTE : - The HTTP specification defines that browsers
			should not download more than two components in parallel.
		</h2>
		<p>An alternative is to use defer="true" in the script tag. The defer attribute specifies that the script should be executed
		   after the page has finished parsing, but it only works for external scripts.
		</p>
		<p>If possible, you can add your script to the page by code, after the page has loaded:</p>
		<h1>Avoid Using with</h1>
		<p>Avoid using the with keyword. It has a negative effect on speed. It also clutters up JavaScript scopes.</p>
		<p>The with keyword is not allowed in strict mode.</p>
		<script src="script.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
		</body>
